KenBro driven by testing,
Develops through proper RESTing.

Quentin can't stand getting calls about MySQL,
Too bad he has to write its new OCP sequel.

Joel gets no sleep,
Writing mad code every week,
Late to the call as we speak,
All that is left is to weep.

Yaling-lee has an underground kombucha production,
All our stomachs receive the healthy reactions!

Emily checked some monitors in Oregon,
And is wondering whether chef will keep itself on.

Herman put together a Rust thing,
No use,
One day his car will start rusting.

So comes to an end this short year,
But all that we need in the end is some beer!
